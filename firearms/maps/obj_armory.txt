-------------------------------

Blue Team Objective:

A temple has been unearthed after a war
time explosion.  The temple was discovered
to be a weapon prototype storage area of
the insidious Red Army.  The Blue Team must
steal the Red Team's prototype firearm and
return it to their Ammory.  The Blue Team
must also protect their own weapon prototype
in order to tip the balance of power in their
favor.

Red Team Objective:

Learning that their weapon prototype storage
facility has been discovered,  the Red Team
has parachuted in to protect their prototype
firearm from falling into enemy hands.
The Red Team must now steal the Blue Team's
prototype firearm and return it to their
Temple while keeping their firearm safe and
secure.  

Scoring:

The team that captures the firearm will
receive +5 reinforcements while the enemy
team will lose -5 reinforcements.

The individual who performs the capture will
receive 5 points and the team will receive
3 points.
