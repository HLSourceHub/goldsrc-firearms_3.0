THANATOS:  The greek god of death.

Objective 1- Destroy the warlord's 3 resources.
scoring: -5 reins per obj destroyed / +1 frag for all 3

A ruthless warlord has been inflicting heavy casualties on your forces
through guerilla tactics and unorthodox warfare.  
It is time to secure the city once and for all.  Your team must destroy all 3
objectives to win.
Place bombs at the opposing team's Ammo Supply, Radio Room and Command APC.
These DO NOT need to be done in order!

OBJECTIVE 2- Capture the Intelligence in the central office.
scoring: +15 reins per document capture / +3 frags

There is important information in the warlord's possession detailing weapons 
shipments, planned military actions and field command center locations.  
These documents must be secured and brought back to your team's safe.  
This is a 3 man job.  Good luck!

Neither objective in OBJ_THANATOS requires the completion 
of the other.
