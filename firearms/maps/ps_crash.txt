On a small island in the pacific ocean:
In an attempt to turn the tide of the war, Red force commanders 
have opted to cut Blue ammo supplies with a decisive strike 
against one of the largest underground munitions depots. 
Artillery defense thwarted the red attack when the lead 
troop-carrying truck was overturned, blocking the path for the 
rest of the platoon. Now, the Red force must move in on foot to 
continue the assault. 

Red Force: Despite losing the trucks, keep pushing the attack on
foot. Secure the city and capture the Blue bunker to take 
control of the ammo stores. This will cut Blue ammo supplies to 
the front. Cutting supplies turn the war in our favor. 

Blue force: Hold the bunker at all costs, and scramble troops 
to intercept the incoming forces. Secure the crash zone and 
repell the attack. The ammo depot is vital to the success 
of the blue campaign.
