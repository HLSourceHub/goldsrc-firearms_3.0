Cold War (Push) : 6-16 players

-== Gameplay notes ==-

You can turn both the fog and snow effects off with
client side variables (consult the online manual
for info).  I do not consider either of
these (turning them off) to be cheap.  If you enjoy
the extra atmosphere of the fog and rain, then 
please keep them on.  If you wish to gain every
little advantage you can, or if the effects cause
major slowdown on your computer, then please, turn
them off.  Everyone has the choice to keep them on
or off, so please don't complain about them.
Thanks.

-== Objective==-

This is a snowy push map with 4 flag areas.  Your
team must push the opposing team back to their base
while capturing all flag areas in sequence.
Once you capture all points, your whole team gets
5 points each and 10 reinforcements.  Each push
point also acts as a control point.  This means
every minute, the opposing team loses 1
reinforcement for each point your team controls.

-== MAP NOTES ==-
every 60 seconds an avalanche occurs in the area 
which is an alternate route to the bridge.  The
avalanche will fill the ravine with snow so you
can pass, but it only lasts for 20 seconds before
it collapses again.  Also, mortars are fired
throughout the level's craters, so watch out for
those!

-== How to Parachute ==-
To parachute, grab a parachute backpack in the plane
and jump out of the plane.  while in mid-air, press
your USE button to open the chute.  You can press
USE again at any time to close the chute.  Once you
land, if you have not yet closed your chute, it will slow
you down until you do.  You get one parachute use per
backpack.
