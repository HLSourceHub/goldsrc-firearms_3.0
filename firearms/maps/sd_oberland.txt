SD_Oberland
By Alex Jordan (aka AlejandroDaJ)

--==STORY==--
A heavily armed group of the Red Workers' Faction (Red team) has
set up operations in a chateau to the northeast of a quiet
mountaintop village in the German Alps. German GSG-9 forces (Blue
team) have arrived at the village via the gondola line to wipe out
the RWF's supplies. However, the terrorists are aware that the
GSG-9 ammo dumps are vulnerable. As a cold autumn night descends, 
the two groups begin battling within the sleepy hamlet...

--==BLUE TEAM==--
Use claymores to destroy the Red Crates, located in the Inn cellar
and inside of the Red chateau's garage.

-==RED TEAM==--
Use claymores to destroy the Blue Crates, located in the village
square's gatehouse and at the Gondola Landing to the south.

---===2.9 Changes===---
•Team respawning due to claying the chateau or gondola crates
has been removed. The round no longer resets.

---===2.8 Changes===---
•Claymores removed from the music room
•Claying either the chateau or gondola crates causes both teams
to respawn [REMOVED]




--==NOTES==--
•R_speeds are rough in a couple of areas (800-900) and I managed
to find one area with r_speeds of 1000. But, otherwise, it shouldn't
be a major issue.
•The statue in the village square is a free, downloadable female model
file on 3dcafe.com. I'm simply using it as a "placeholder" right now,
as it has too many epolys to be useful. I'm waiting for a better, more
low-poly statue from Ben.
•No Menkeys yet!  :(       I MUST FIX THAT.
