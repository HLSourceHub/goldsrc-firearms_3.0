Operation Marie (Push)

 By Michael Hope
 Updated by Alex Jordan

Blue Force storms the beach and gets to
the town the Red Force is hiding out in.
Red Force pushes forward to the beach and 
prevents the invasion of its chokehold 
on the North Banks.

---===2.9 Changes===---
•Light panels have been removed from the cave, making it
completely dark. NVG users, enjoy!

---===2.8 Changes===---
•Fixed the hall-of-mirror effect in the alternate red route to
the bridge
•Added a switchback path route from the canyon to the blue side
of the bridge, which should hopefully facilitate map balance
