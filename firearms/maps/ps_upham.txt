Upham - City conquer (Push)

  By Toni Hiltunen (toni@planethalflife.com)

Each team must try to capture all
capture points of the map.
Once your team captures all 3 capture points,
all players respawn,
your team's lives increase,
and the team gains points

There are 3 capture points in this mission.
One in North part of the town,
2nd in the church (middle of the city) and
3rd in southern part of the town.
