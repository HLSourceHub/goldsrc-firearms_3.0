The Bocage (Objective)

By Alex Jordan and Graham Davis

Infantry fighting beyond the beachhead in the French bocage
must infiltrate an enemy-held village and destroy four objectives:
first, 3 guns must be destroyed so you can reach the bridge, which must also be destroyed.

-=BLUE TEAM=-
• First find the 3 field guns and destroy them by placing a bomb in each of their
  bomb areas.
• Next, find the bridge and destroy it as well.
• Destroy items by finding the floating boxes with red handles and walking into them for a hold
  of 3 seconds long.
• Use the tactical map in your spawn to get your bearings.
• Destroying any given field gun awards you 3 frags and 2 reinforcements
• Setting each bridge bomb (2 total) awards you 2 frags. Once the bridge explodes, Blue team
is awarded 4 reinforcements (10 total for the round).

-=RED TEAM=-
• You will receive 3 extra reinforcements every 4 minutes to help hold off blue.
• Defend the bridge and the guns.

---===Extra gameplay notes===---
• If blue tries to reach the bridge before all 3 guns are destroyed, the remaining
guns will fire mortars onto the blue team (so destroy all guns so you can reach the bridge!)
• Once the 3 guns are destroyed and only the bridge remains, the red team will all spawn at either
the bridgehouse area, or an equi-distance from the bridge as blue's spawn.  This should create
intense final battles for the bridge area. 
• you must remain in each bomb area for 4 seconds to place a bomb.  If you move from the bomb area,
  the 4 second time will restart.

---===2.8 Changes===---
• There is now an underground sewer tunnel running from the field gun to near the bridge. It is
covered by a metal grate that only opens after all 3 guns have been destroyed. It is also only
navigable with Night Vision Goggles.
• The objective system has been redone to be more efficient.
• Planting explosives now takes 4 seconds. Despite the map's earlier claims, planting did NOT take
3 seconds. Although the map counted down from 3, it only updated the count every 1.5 seconds...
hence, it used to take 4.5 seconds to plant explosives.

KNOWN BUGS:
• If you break off planting explosives and try planting again within 5 seconds, either the count-
down restarts where it left off or it restarts where it left off, abruptly resets, and then proceeds
to count down from 4 again.
• There is a VIS-ing bug at the end of the new sewer tunnel that causes the water near the bridge
to flicker into view briefly.

---===2.65 Changes===---
• Attempting to enter any opponent's spawn (including the house near the warehouse where Red spawns
alternately after the three guns have been destroyed) results in an instant kill. This is to
prevent spawn-camping. For those of you that have no attention spans, a message as to why you died
appears after entering a non-campable zone.
• Extra route from the crossroads to the bridge added.
• Extra route from Blue's spawn added that is shielded from the clock tower.
• Minor wpoly and performance tweaks.
