Map Objective: There are three territorial control points, which must be 
captured in order.
-From blue's side they go: 
  train station > radio studio (top floor of building with elevator) > armory
-From red's side they go:
  armory > radio studio (top floor of building with elevator) > train station
-For every 30 seconds (cumulatively) that a team holds all the points 
("controls the map"), they gain 1 reinforcement, and the enemy team 
loses 1.
-For every 60 seconds (cumulatively) that a team holds all the points, 
each team member gains 1 point.
-There are signs on the exterior and interior of each cap point to indicate 
which team controls that point.
-After a point is capped, there is a five to six second delay before the next
point can be capped or the opposing team can recap the point.
