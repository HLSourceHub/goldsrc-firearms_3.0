River (Push)
 
By Graham Davis

Special thanks to:

• Belial for the side tree texture
• Ben for the splash sprite
• Svante Ekholm for some of the bush textures

Gameplay notes:

You can turn both the fog and rain effects off with
client side variables (consult the online manual
for info).  I do not consider either of
these (turning them off) to be cheap.  If you enjoy
the extra atmosphere of the fog and rain, then 
please keep them on.  If you wish to gain every
little advantage you can, or if the effects cause
major slowdown on your computer, then please, turn
them off.  Everyone has the choice to keep them on
or off, so please don't complain about them.
Thanks.


Objectives:

Each team must try to capture all check points of the map
in sequence. Once your team captures all push points, all
players respawn, your team's reinforcements increase by 
10, and the members of the scoring team gains 5 points
each.  Also, each push point acts as a control point. 
This means that every minute, the opposing team loses
1 reinforcement for each point your team controls.
