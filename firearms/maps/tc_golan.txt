By Alex Jordan (aka AlejandroDaJ)

--==STORY==--
A localized Syrian counterattack threatens Israeli possession
of a strategic defensive system on the Golan Heights. Syrian
forces (Red Team) has captured one compound, while the Israelis
(Blue Team) have fallen back to an auxiliary compound. Both sides
are now battling for control of the hill. 

--==OBJECTIVES==--
Take control of the TC points in the village, the central bunker,
and the mobile command track in the forest.

For each point held, 1 reinforcement is deducted from the opposing
team every 20 seconds, the system used by BF1942.

--==2.8 Changes==--
•The cliffs have been CLIPed to prevent exploiting
•The trumpet sound-playing ambient generic entities have been
removed from the TC points. The push entities still causes the
trumpet sound to play, but not when the point is grabbed by someone
with Stealth. In the 2.7 version, even a player with Stealth
would trigger the trumpet noise.
