Credits: 18
Type: Sniper Rifle
Caliber: .50 BMG
Capacity: 10 Round Box Magazine
ROF: Semi Automatic
Description:
This massive rifle fires the same .50 caliber
round used in heavy machineguns and the
tail guns of the B-52 bomber. Although 
intended to be fired on armored vehicles
and airplanes, there is no denying its
effectiveness against 'softer' targets.
