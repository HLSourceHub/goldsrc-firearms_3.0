The Assault configuration is a good set up for players who like to be right in the thick of things. Recommended for close range combat only, the FA-MAS' superior rate of fire will make short work of anyone unfortunate enough to be within range. The M93R is a very capable machine pistol, ideal as backup for the low capacity FA-MAS.
