The Grenadier configuration is tailored to players who prefer medium to long range combat, with the added bonus of a grenade launcher. While the M16A2 is limited to semi automatic and three round burst fire only, with a bit of practice it can be used just as effectively as any fully automatic weapon, and once you get a feel for the M203 grenade launcher, you will be raining grenades down on people with ease.
