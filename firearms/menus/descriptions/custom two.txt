The Machinegunner configuration is for players who enjoy spitting out very high quantities of ammunition in a very short time. If it is appropriately deployed, a single machinegun can dissuade enemies from using certain routes altogether. The machinegunner is an essential part of any squad, especially in situations that require a high amount of suppressive fire.
