Description:
The Uzi is built for close-quarters combat,
its ROF making it controllable yet deadly.
When equipped with a suppressor, it's also
exceedingly quiet, making it an ideal choice
for stealthy operations.

[To suppress this weapon, you must have
the "Stealth" skill.  Secondary fire attaches
and detatches the suppressor.]
