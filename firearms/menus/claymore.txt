Credits: 4
Type: Explosive
Description:
This remote-detonation mine uses
a C4 charge to send some 600 ball
bearings into its blast zone, doing
phenomenal damage to anything in their
path. The M18A1 is ideal for ambushes,
and can be used as a booby trap when
set to "trip" mode.

[To set an M18A1 on "trip" mode, use
your secondary fire command.  Once set
for "trip," you will not be able to
switch back to manual detonation.]
