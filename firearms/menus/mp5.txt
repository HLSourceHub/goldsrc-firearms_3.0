Description:
The closed-bolt MP5A4 is known for its
accuracy and reliability. A shooter with the
correct parts on hand may reconfigure it as
a suppressed MP5SD5 for when a stealthier
approach is needed.

[To suppress this weapon, you must have
the "Stealth" skill.  Secondary fire attaches
and detatches the suppressor.]
