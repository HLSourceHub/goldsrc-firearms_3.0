Credits: 14
Type: Assault Rifle
Caliber: 5.45x39mm Russian
Capacity: 30 Round Box Magazine
ROF: 800 Rounds Per Minute
Description:
Although its relatively light 5.45mm round
doesn't have a high energy transfer, the 
AK-74 makes up for this with a high rate of 
fire and by being reasonably controllable.
Grenadiers may use an under-barrel GP-25
grenade launcher with this weapon, adding
flexibility and firepower to their squad.

[To equip and use the GP-25, you must
choose the "Artillery I" skill.  Secondary
fire switches between the AK-74 and the
GP-25.]
