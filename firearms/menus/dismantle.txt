This ability will allow you to dismantle your mortar. You must be 
standing by your mortar in order to dismantle it. If there are any 
rounds in the mortar's supply when it is dismantled, they will be added
to your inventory. Remember, you can only carry 5 rounds at a time,
so any additional rounds will be discarded. You can not dismantle
any mortar but your own.
