Description:
The M14 rifle was adopted by the US military
in 1957 as a replacement for the M1 Garand.
While it was capable of fully automatic firing,
it was usually issued locked in semi automatic
mode, to avoid the waste of ammunition.
Production ceased in 1964 after disappointing
performance in South East Asia, and it was
gradually replaced with the M16 assault rifle.
However, it is still popular amongst special
operations groups such as the US Navy's SEALs.

[To use the A.C.O.G scope on the M14, you
must choose the "Marksmanship I" skill.]
