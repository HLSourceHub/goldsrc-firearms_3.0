Remington M870
Credits: 8
Type: Shotgun
Caliber: 12 Gauge, 3 Inch Buckshot
Capacity: 7 Round Tubular Magazine
ROF: Pump-Action
Description:
The M870 is ideal for close-range house-to-
house or brush fighting, but suffers at long
range due to its spread and low velocity
projectiles. Great for engaging moving targets,
and its stopping power at close range is
undeniable.
