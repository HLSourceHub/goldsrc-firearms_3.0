Credits: 13
Type: Assault Rifle
Caliber: 5.56x45mm NATO
Capacity: 30 Round Box Magazine
ROF: 800 Rounds Per Minute
Description:
The M16A2's accuracy is favored by many,
although its restriction to semi automatic and
burst-fire only can be somewhat of a draw-
back in heavy fighting. Grenadiers may use
an under-barrel M203 grenade launcher with
this weapon, adding flexibility and firepower
to their squad.

[To equip and use the M203, you must
choose the "Artillery I" skill.  Secondary
fire switches between the M16A2 and the
M203.]
