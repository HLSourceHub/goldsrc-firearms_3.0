The following is a list of the valid tokens that can be placed in the “custom *.txt”
file (where * is a number) to be loaded from the Configurations menu by clicking the
“Quick Config” button. These files are fully customizable.

The first line is the name of your custom class ('Sniper', for example). This name will
be displayed on the desgnated button when you choose a preconfigured class. The _armor
tokens are required next, and must lead the rest of the configuration tokens. They are
the tokens that determine the amount of credits that the rest of the configuration will
use to buy the items that follow not to include skill tokens. Putting these tokens
anywhere in the file but at the beginning of your desired configuration, will cause all
items above this token to be discarded. The 3 valid _armor tokens are:

	light_armor
	medium_armor
	heavy_armor

The rest of the item tokens do not have to be in any particular order but they must be in
the order that you would like them to be purchased in. If there are not enough credits
available to make the desired purchase it will be discarded and the next token will be
evaluated. The valid item purchase tokens are:

	helmet			- Kevlar Helmet	
	arms			- Kevlar Arm Protection
	legs			- Kevlar Leg Protection
	frag			- M54 Fragmentation Grenade
	conc			- Concussion Grenade
	claymore		- M18A1 Claymore Mine
	bandages		- Bandages
	nvg			- Night Vision Goggles
	1911a1			- Colt Government Model 1911A1
	anaconda		- Colt Anaconda
	93r			- Beretta Model 93R
	92f			- Beretta Model 92F
	deagle			- Magnum Research/IMI Desert Eagle
	remington		- Remington M870
	12k			- Saiga 12K
	sterling		- Sterling L2A3MK4
	mp5			- Heckler and Koch MP5A4
	bizon			- Bizon-II
	uzi 			- UZI
	ak47			- AK-47
	ak74			- AK-74 
	famas			- FA-MAS
	g3a3			- Heckler and Koch G3A3
	g36e			- Heckler and Koch G36E
	m14			- M14
	m16			- Colt M16A2
	m4			- Colt M4 Carbine
	m82			- Barrett M82A1
	dragunov		- Dragunov SVD
	m60			- M60
	pkm			- PKM
	m249			- M249
	m79			- M79


The skill tokens can be placed anywhere in the file you desire and must be placed in
the order that you would like them to be chosen.  When a skill token is chosen, you
will be charged for the skill, the skill will be given and the next token will be
evaluated. If the skill is already chosen, then the token will be discarded but you
will still be charged for the skill.  All minor skills must precede its major skill.
For instance, you can’t have Field Medicine before First Aid, Artillery II before
Artillery I or Marksmanship II before Marksmanship I.  Otherwise you will be charged
for the skill but the skill will be discarded.

It is recommended that you keep all 10 skills tokens in this file regardless of the
servers “sv_useskills” setting.  Although you will probably not be able to obtain all
skills, the purpose is that so that if you have the skill points available, then skill 
purchasing will proceed in order until all your available skill points are spent.  The 
amount of skill points are determined by the server setting.  If on a “sv_useskills 0” 
server, all skill tokens will be discarded.  On a “sv_useskills 1” rank advance server,
you will earn a skill point at time of rank advance with 1 automatic skill point on
server join.  A “sv_useskills 2” server will award you 4 skill points to spend regardless
of rank.  On a “sv_useskills 3” server, all skill tokens are discarded because you have
all skills to begin with.  The following tokens are the valid skill tokens:

	marksmanship1
	marksmanship2
	nomenclature
	battlefield_agility
	leadership
	first_aid
	field_medicine
	artillery1
	artillery2
	stealth
